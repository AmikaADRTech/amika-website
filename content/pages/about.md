      Why AMIKA?






      Indian Courts are undergoing a

      number of challenges like mounting overload of work, increasing number of

      cases, and piling up of pendency, in addition to receipt and disposal of
      cases

      that do not require litigation in a formal judicial system and can be
      resolved

      through an open dialogue between litigants. The situation warrants
      alternative

      dispute resolution methods. It was in this background; that a Conference
      of

      Chief Ministers and Chief Justices of various states was held in New Delhi
      on

      4th December 1993 under the Chairmanship of the then Prime Minister of
      India

      and presided over by the Chief Justice of India. The Conference has passed
      the

      following resolution:






      The Chief Ministers and Chief

      Justices believed that Courts were not in a position to bear the entire
      burden

      of the justice system and that many disputes lent themselves to resolution
      by

      alternative modes such as arbitration, mediation and negotiation. They

      emphasized the desirability of disputants taking advantage of alternative

      dispute resolution which provided procedural flexibility, saved valuable
      time

      and money and avoided the stress of a conventional trial. It was felt that
      in a

      developing country like India with major economic reforms underway within
      the

      \-work of rule of law, strategies for swifter resolution of disputes for

      lessening the burden on the Courts and to provide means for expeditious

      resolution of disputes, there is no better option but to strive to develop

      alternative modes of dispute resolution by establishing facilities for

      providing settlement of disputes through arbitration, conciliation,
      mediation,

      negotiation‚Äù ( Ref: ICADR website). Thereafter, Arbitration, Conciliation,
      and

      Mediation have gained prominence






      For early settlement of

      disputes by arbitration, the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, of 1996 was

      enacted that was brought into force with effect from 22 August 1996. Thus,

      Arbitration has become a part of Alternative Disputes Resolution.
      Furthermore,

      it appears from the amended Section 89(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure,
      1908

      that the court has to refer the disputes either by way of an Arbitration,

      Conciliation, Judicial settlement, settlement through Lok Adalats or
      Mediation

      if the courts feel that there are elements of the settlement.
      Additionally,

      Section 12 A of the Commercial Courts Act 2015 makes Mediation at the

      Pre-Institution Stage of the litigation mandatory. Later, Commercial
      Courts

      (Pre-Institution Mediation and Settlement) Rules, 2018 were notified on
      3rd

      July 2018.


      The Mediation and Conciliation

      Project Committee (MCPC) 2005 established by the Honourable Supreme Court
      of

      India has encouraged Mediation as a method of resolving disputes out of
      court

      for amicable settlement. All the courts in India, have thereafter
      established

      Mediation centres within their premises to refer the matters for amicable

      settlement.






      Taking a cue from the

      available legislation in India on Mediation, Arbitration, and Conciliation

      AMIKA has been established as a Registered Society for Alternative
      Disputes

      Resolution under the Societies Registration Act for taking up disputes for
      an

      out-of-court settlement.
