      ### Why AMIKA?


      Indian Courts are undergoing a number of challenges like mounting overload
      of work, increasing number of cases, piling up of pendency, in addition to
      receipt and disposal of cases that do not require litigation in a formal
      judicial system and can be resolved through an open dialogue between
      litigants. The situation warrants for alternative dispute resolution
      methods. It was in this background; a Conference of Chief Ministers and
      Chief Justices of various states was held in New Delhi on 4th December
      1993 under the Chairmanship of the then Prime Minister of India and
      presided over by the Chief Justice of India. The Conference has passed the
      following resolution:


      The Chief Ministers and Chief Justices were of the opinion that Courts
      were not in a position to bear the entire burden of justice system and
      that a number of disputes lent themselves to resolution by alternative
      modes such as arbitration, mediation and negotiation. They emphasized the
      desirability of disputants taking advantage of alternative dispute
      resolution which provided procedural flexibility, saved valuable time and
      money and avoided the stress of a conventional trial. It was felt that in
      a developing country like India with major economic reforms under way
      within the -work of rule of law, strategies for swifter resolution of
      disputes for lessening the burden on the Courts and to provide means for
      expeditious resolution of disputes, there is no better option but to
      strive to develop alternative modes of dispute resolution by establishing
      facilities for providing settlement of disputes through arbitration,
      conciliation, mediation, negotiation” ( Ref: ICADR website). Thereafter,
      Arbitration, Conciliation, and Mediation have gained prominence


      For early settlement of disputes by arbitration, the Arbitration and
      Conciliation Act, 1996 was enacted that was brought into force with effect
      from 22 August1996. Thus, Arbitration has become a part of Alternative
      Disputes Resolution. Furthermore, it appears from the amended Section
      89(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 that it is the duty of the
      court to refer the disputes either by way of an Arbitration, Conciliation,
      Judicial settlement, settlement through Lok Adalats or Mediation if the
      courts feels that there are elements of settlement. Additionally, Section
      12 A of Commercial Courts Act 2015 makes Mediation at Pre-Institution
      Stage of the litigation mandatory. Later, Commercial Courts
      (Pre-Institution Mediation and Settlement) Rules, 2018 were notified on
      3rd July 2018.


      The Mediation and Conciliation Project Committee (MCPC) 2005 established
      by the Honourable Supreme Court of India has encourage Mediation as a
      method of resolving disputes out of court for amicable settlement. All the
      courts in India, have thereafter established Mediation centres within
      their premises to refer the matters for amicable settlement.


      Taking cue from the available legislations in India on Mediation,
      Arbitration, and Conciliation AMIKA has been established as a Registered
      Society for Alternative Disputes Resolution under societies registration
      act for taking up the disputes for out of court settlement.
