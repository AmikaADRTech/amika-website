      ### Why AMIKA AMC?


      Indian Courts are undergoing a number of challenges like mounting overload
      of work, increasing number of cases, and piling up of pendency, in
      addition to receipt and disposal of cases that do not require litigation
      in a formal judicial system and can be resolved through an open dialogue
      between litigants. The situation warrants alternative dispute resolution
      methods. It was in this background; that a Conference of Chief Ministers
      and Chief Justices of various states was held in New Delhi on 4th December
      1993 under the Chairmanship of the then Prime Minister of India and
      presided over by the Chief Justice of India. The Conference has passed the
      following resolution:


      The Chief Ministers and Chief Justices were of the opinion that Courts
      were not in a position to bear the entire burden of the justice system and
      that a number of disputes lent themselves to resolution by alternative
      modes such as arbitration, mediation and negotiation. They emphasized the
      desirability of disputants taking advantage of alternative dispute
      resolution which provided procedural flexibility, saved valuable time and
      money and avoided the stress of a conventional trial. It was felt that in
      a developing country like India with major economic reforms underway
      within the -work of rule of law, strategies for swifter resolution of
      disputes for lessening the burden on the Courts and to provide means for
      expeditious resolution of disputes, there is no better option but to
      strive to develop alternative modes of dispute resolution by establishing
      facilities for providing settlement of disputes through arbitration,
      conciliation, mediation, negotiation‚Äù ( Ref: ICADR website). Thereafter,
      Arbitration, Conciliation, and Mediation have gained prominence


      For early settlement of disputes by arbitration, the Arbitration and
      Conciliation Act, of 1996 was enacted that was brought into force with
      effect from 22 August 1996. Thus, Arbitration has become a part of
      Alternative Disputes Resolution. Furthermore, it appears from the amended
      Section 89(1) of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 that it is the duty of
      the court to refer the disputes either by way of an Arbitration,
      Conciliation, Judicial settlement, settlement through Lok Adalats or
      Mediation if the courts feel that there are elements of the settlement.
      Additionally, Section 12 A of the Commercial Courts Act 2015 makes
      Mediation at the Pre-Institution Stage of the litigation mandatory. Later,
      Commercial Courts (Pre-Institution Mediation and Settlement) Rules, 2018
      were notified on 3rd July 2018.


      The Mediation and Conciliation Project Committee (MCPC) 2005 established
      by the Honourable Supreme Court of India has encouraged Mediation as a
      method of resolving disputes out of court for amicable settlement. All the
      courts in India, have thereafter established Mediation centres within
      their premises to refer the matters for amicable settlement.


      Taking a cue from the available legislation in India on Mediation,
      Arbitration, and Conciliation AMIKA has been established as a Registered
      Society for Alternative Disputes Resolution under the Societies
      Registration Act for taking up disputes for an out-of-court settlement.
